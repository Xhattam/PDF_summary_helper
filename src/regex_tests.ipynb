      "Aspect level sentiment classification is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, compared to the sentence level classification. A sentence usually contains one or more aspects. To detect the sentiment towards a particular aspect in a sentence, previous studies have developed various methods for generating aspect-specific sentence representations. However, these studies handle each aspect of a sentence separately. In this paper, we argue that multiple aspects of a sentence are usually orthogonal based on the observation that different aspects concentrate on different parts of the sentence. To force the orthogonality among aspects, we propose constrained attention networks (CAN) for multi-aspect sentiment analysis, which handles multiple aspects of a sentence simultaneously. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We also extend our approach to multi-task settings, outperforming the state-of-the-arts significantly.\n",

      "Sentiment analysis \\cite{Nasukawa2003Sentiment,liu2012sentiment}, an important task in natural language understanding, receives much attention in recent years. Aspect level sentiment classification is a fine-grained sentiment analysis task, which aims at detecting the sentiment towards a particular aspect in a sentence. A multi-aspect sentence (\\emph{i.e.}, the sentence contains more than one aspect) can be categorized as {\\bf overlapping} or {\\bf non-overlapping}. A sentence is annotated as non-overlapping only if any two of its aspects have no overlap. One key observation is that around $85\\%$ of the multi-aspect sentences are non-overlapping in the two public datasets. Figure \\ref{sentence} shows a simple example. The non-overlapping sentence contains two aspects. The aspect \\emph{food} is in the left part of the sentence while \\emph{service} in the right part. Their distributions on words are {\\bf orthogonal} to each other. Another observation is that only a few words relate to the opinion expression in each aspect. As shown in Figure \\ref{sentence}, only the word \\emph{``great''} is relevant to the aspect \\emph{food} and \\emph{``dreadful\"} to \\emph{service}. The distribution of the opinion expression of each aspect is {\\bf sparse}. \n",
      "\n",
      "To detect the sentiment towards a particular aspect, previous studies \\cite{Wang2016Attention,Ma2017Interactive,cheng2017aspect,ma2018targeted,huang2018aspect,wang2018learning} have developed various attention-based methods for generating aspect-specific sentence representations. To name a few, \\cite{Wang2016Attention} proposes attention-based LSTMs for aspect level sentiment classification. The attention mechanism can concentrate on different parts of a sentence when different aspects are taken as input. %By learning an aspect-specific representation of a sentence, they are more competitive for aspect level classification. \n",
      "\\cite{wang2018learning} proposes a segmentation attention based LSTM model which can effectively capture the structural dependencies between the target and the sentiment expressions with a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) layer. However, all these works are single-aspect sentiment analysis, which deals with aspects in a sentence one at a time, ignoring the orthogonality among multiple aspects. \n",

      "\n",
      "Therefore, we propose a model for multi-aspect sentiment analysis, which handles multiple aspects of a sentence simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce orthogonal regularization for attention weights among multiple non-overlapping aspects. The orthogonal regularization tends to make the attention weights of multiple aspects concentrate on different parts of the sentence with less overlap. We also introduce the sparse regularization, which tends to make the attention weights of each aspect concentrate only on a few words. We call our networks with such regularizations {\\bf constrained attention networks} (CAN). The implementation of adding regularization terms to attention weights of multiple aspects is similar to adding the penalization term in self-attention in \\cite{lin2017structured}. The details will be introduced in the model section.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to aspect level sentiment classification ({\\bf ALSC}), aspect category detection ({\\bf ACD}) is another task of aspect based sentiment analysis. We introduce ACD as an auxiliary task to assist the ALSC task, benefiting from the shared context of the two tasks. Aspect category detection~\\cite{Zhou2015Representation,Schouten2018Supervised} is a task which aims to identify the aspect categories discussed in a given sentence from a predefined set of aspect categories (e.g., price, food, service). Take Figure \\ref{sentence} as an example, aspect categories \\emph{food} and \\emph{service} are mentioned. We also apply our attention constraints to the ACD task. By applying attention weight constraints to both ALSC and ACD tasks in an end-to-end network, we further evaluate the effectiveness of CAN in multi-task settings.\n",

      "{\\bf Single-task Settings} Table \\ref{table-st} shows our experimental results of aspect level sentiment classification in single-task settings. Firstly, we observe that by introducing attention regularizations (either $R_s$ or $R_o$), most of our proposed methods outperform their counterparts. Specifically, AT-CAN-$R_s$ and AT-CAN-$R_o$ outperform AT-LSTM in $7$ of $8$ results; ATAE-CAN-$R_s$ and ATAE-CAN-$R_o$ also outperform ATAE-LSTM in $7$ of $8$ results. For example, in the Rest15 dataset, ATAE-CAN-$R_o$ outperforms ATAE-LSTM by up to $7.64\\%$ in the Binary classification. Secondly, regularization $R_o$ achieves better performance improvement than $R_s$ in all results. This is because $R_o$ includes both orthogonal and sparse regularizations for non-overlapping multi-aspect sentences. Finally, the LSTM method outputs the worst results in all cases, because it can not distinguish different aspects. We do not add regularization terms to the LSTM method since no attention weights are computed in this method. \n",
      "\n",
      "% 在Finally之前     It is worth noting that if a dataset contains only a small portion of multi-aspect sentences, the regularization $R_o$ may not outperform much than $R_s$.\n",

      "We propose constrained attention networks for multi-aspect sentiment analysis, which handles multiple aspects of a sentence simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce orthogonal and sparse regularizations on attention weights. Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary task ACD for promoting the ALSC task, and apply CAN on both tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-arts significantly. \n",
