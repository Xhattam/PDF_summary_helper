\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
This study focuses on the task of multi-passage reading comprehension (RC) where an answer is provided in natural language. Current mainstream approaches treat RC by extracting the answer span from the provided passages and cannot generate an abstractive summary from the given question and passages. Moreover, they cannot utilize and control different styles of answers, such as concise phrases and well-formed sentences, within a model.
In this study, we propose a style-controllable Multi-source Abstractive Summarization model for QUEstion answering, called Masque. The model is an end-to-end deep neural network that can generate answers conditioned on a given style.
Experiments with MS MARCO 2.1 show that our model achieved state-of-the-art performance
on two tasks with different answer styles.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Problem Formulation}

\begin{problem}
\label{prob:prob}
Given a question with $J$ words $x^q = \{x^q_1, \ldots, x^q_J\}$, a set of $K$ passages, where each $k$-th passage is composed of $L$ words $x^{p_k} = \{x^{p_k}_1, \ldots, x^{p_k}_{L}\}$, and an answer style $s$, an RC system
outputs an answer $y = \{y_1, \ldots, y_T \}$ conditioned on the style.
\end{problem}

\section{Proposed Model}

\end{figure}

\begin{layer1}
The \textbf{question-passages reader} (\S\ref{sec:reader}) models interactions between the question and passages.
\end{layer1}

\begin{layer1}
The \textbf{passage ranker} (\S\ref{sec:ranker}) finds relevant passages to the question.
\end{layer1}

\subsection{Question-Passages Reader}

\subsubsection{Word Embedding Layer}

\subsubsection{Dual Attention Layer}

\begin{align}
U^{p_k}_{lj} = {w^a}^\top [ E^{p_k}_l; E^q_j; E^{p_k}_l \odot E^q_j ]
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Modeling Encoder Layer}

\paragraph{Copy distribution.}

\begin{align}
e^q_j &= {w^q}^\top \tanh(W^{qm} M_j^q + W^{qs} s_t +b^q), \\
\alpha^q_t &= \mathrm{softmax}(e^q), \\
c^q_t &= \textstyle \sum_j \alpha^q_{tj} M_j^q, \\
e^{p_k}_l &= {w^p}^\top \tanh(W^{pm} M_l^{p_k} + W^{ps} s_t +b^p), \\
\alpha^p_t &= \mathrm{softmax}([e^{p_1}; \ldots; e^{p_K}]), \\
c^p_t &=  \textstyle \sum_{l} \alpha^p_{tl} M^{p_\mathrm{all}}_{l},
\end{align}

\begin{align}
P^q(y_t) &=  \textstyle \sum_{j: x^q_j = y_t} \alpha^q_{tj}, \\
P^p(y_t) &= \textstyle \sum_{l: x^{p_{k(l)}}_{l} = y_t} \alpha^p_{tl},
\end{align}
